## General Information
Individuals can rent or borrow bikes from a bike-sharing system on a short-term basis for a fee or for free. To unlock the bicycle, the user enters their payment information into a computer-controlled "dock," which is usually located in a public place. Afterwards, this bike can be returned to another dock of the same system.

Revenues for a US bike-sharing service BoomBikes have recently dropped significantly due to the ongoing Corona pandemic in America. The current market conditions are making it difficult for the company to continue. When the current lockdown ends and the economy returns to a healthy state, the company has decided to devise a business plan that will allow it to quickly increase its revenue.

After the Covid-19 quarantine ends, BoomBikes hopes to learn more about the demand for shared bikes from the general public. They have planned this in order to be ready to serve the people's needs once the situation improves and stand out from other service providers and make enormous profits..

They've hired a consulting firm to help them figure out what drives demand for these bikes. For this study, they're looking at the factors that drive demand for these shared bikes in the United States, specifically. What's the company's interest?

In predicting the demand for shared bicycles, what factors are most important to keep in mind.
